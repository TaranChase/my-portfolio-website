                 Hi! I'm Taran, an aspiring Software Engineer at Moringa School.<br>Solving Problems through creation of Apps that can be utilized by others is something that intrigues me and motivates me to learn coding.<br>Outside of learning how to code, you'll probably find me: 
                Binge-watcing anime series and analyzing every plot twist. <br>
                Learning a New Language because Duo won't let me take a break! And reading books that alter my mindset!
